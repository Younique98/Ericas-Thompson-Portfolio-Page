                        <pre>Within the past nine months I have taught classes to military spouses and civilians that teaches the fundamentals of Business life.  Topics include Military Family Balance while owning a business, Financial Crisis Mode, Digital Marketing and Web Presence, Mail Campaigns and Business Management, Problem Solving and more.  Teaching the classes are great but my passion shows in my role as a Instructor, helper and organizer at the Family Credit Repair and Small Business Development Orientation held every Second Saturday.  This passion has been recognized by the many small businesses of the area and I was asked to streamline the Marketing plans of local businesses.  My role as Supervisor at Radiant Homes and Small Business Coordinator was to coordinate a volunteer sign up for the newcomer’s orientation, assist in the training Assistants of business and share the program to increase awareness and participation.  

The event was held at the Montgomery County Library and has been a staple part of the military community and was able to help many families attack their debt and also fuel the growth of small businesses.  I am committed to military members and their families.  I know that my experience during being an instructor at  Montgomery County Library for Family Debt Relief and Small Business Development  , Educator and Superving Lead would be an asset to the team.  My passion for the military and civilians will be seen with every soldier, spouse or civilian I meet as I can relate being a military spouse myself.
