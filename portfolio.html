      <h3>Projects I have built for local small businesses</h3>
          <p>This taught me how to pitch and market myself to <b>local companies</b> within the city.</p>
          <ul>
              <li>There were many who said no but there was also <b>many who said Yes</b> and those were relationships I still have to this day.</li>
              <li>There were also many learning curves as sometimes I ran into things I had never seen before but thats where <b>Stack OverFlow and Documentation</b> saved the day.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I was shy and unsure of myself at first.</p>
          <p><b>Terrified</b> that I would let someone down. That gave me the fuel and determination to learn all that I could </p>

      <h3>Projects I have built for local non-profits</h3>
          <p>This taught me how to lead a team and market to <b>non-profit companies</b> within the city.</p>
          <ul>
              <li>I met wonderful people with grand <b>Visions</b> on a shoe string budget.</li>
              <li>I also learned how to voice my opinon and speak up <b>by joining my local Toast Masters Section</b> so that I could guide the conversations towards reaching the end goal.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The projects sometimes spiraled into bigger projects and those individuals introduced me to others within their circle.</p>
          <p><b>Becoming the go to person for webdesign</b> and eventually starting two very popular MeetUp groups to teach others just like me was a dream come true. </p>
